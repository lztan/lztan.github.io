The limits of nonlinear optics: second harmonic generation and shift current
============================================================================

Second harnomic generation (SHG) and shift current are both nonlinear optical effects of fundamental and techonological
interest, and it is often desirable to maximize their effects in materials.
I have obtained theoretical upper bounds for the magnitude of the second-order susceptibilities of polar semiconductors.
This bound reveals that these nonlinear optical effects are controlled by the ratio of the band width to the band gap,
and by the range of long-distance hopping in the material. A comparison of these upper bounds with the response
functions of known materials obtained from ab-initio calculations suggests that future materials research will likely
uncover large SHG and shift current materials.



Structural fluctuations of halide perovskite photovoltaics
==========================================================

The lead-halide perovskites have shown exceptional promise as high-efficiency solar cells, but much remains to be understood
about the reason for their high efficiency, and the effect of dynamically disordered, strongly fluctuating crystal structure.
Using molecular dynamics and computational Raman spectroscopy compared against experiment, we have identified the
structural motifs responsible for dynamic disorder in this class of materials. Our results reveal that fluctuations of the 
inorganic lead-halide cage and anharmonic displacive motion of A-site cations play important roles in the dynamics of these 
materials.

We have detected footprints of these structural fluctuations in excited state spectroscopy, revealing that the
photogenerated carriers participate in non-themal cooling, preferentially exciting volume-preserving distortions of the lead-halide 
octahedral cages. 


Spin-orbit effects in halide perovskite photovoltaics
=====================================================

Radiative recombination is often viewed as a major, and unavoidable loss channel in photovoltaics. In the halide perovskites,
we have postulated that spin-orbit effects are playing a role in suppressing radiative recombination, which 
contributes to the long carrier lifetime in these materials. This is a direct consequence of the 
Rashba effect causing spin-splitting of the valence and conduction bands. Combined experimental and theoretical efforts 
have detected the presence of the Rashba effect in the magneto-optical spectra of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. 


Topological effects in nonlinear optics
=======================================

Myraid strategies have been proposed to increase the magnitude of nonlinear optical effects, such as the 
shift current bulk photovoltaic effect. We have shown that topological insulators have the unique feature
that their electronic band structure is often rapidly varying in reciprocal space, which
dramatically enhances the bulk photovoltaic effect. Tuning a normal insulator to a band inversion transition
is predicted to cause an abrupt reversal of the bulk photocurrent, concurrent with a large enhancement.
